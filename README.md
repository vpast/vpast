## About Me
    

My name is Vlad. I started learning frontend development in university while also studying C++, Python, and C#. I later taught myself JavaScript and React.js through online courses and documentation. To date, I have created a portfolio of four projects that demonstrate my skills, with the source code and demos available on my GitHub: [https://github.com/vpast](https://github.com/vpast)

  

I became a software developer because I love working with innovative technologies. In frontend development, I am inspired by seeing my efforts materialize into visually compelling websites. But I don't see myself as a purely "computer person": I'm good at communicating with people of different backgrounds and ages. I practice active listening, pay attention to details, and learn quickly. In my work, I aim to balance quality and speed to deliver the best results.

  

While I have worked on my own a lot, I enjoy being part of a team because working together allows us to solve problems better by bringing together our diverse strengths and viewpoints. So, I'm looking to join a company where I can contribute to the creation and enhancement of your awesome products.
